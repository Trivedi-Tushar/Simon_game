# Simon_game
It is an electronic game where the player repeats a sequence of colored lights and sounds in the correct order.
The game has four colored buttons that correspond to different musical notes.
Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence randomly.
To play, the game shows a pattern of colors and sounds, and the player must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons.
If the player succeeds, the game adds another color to the sequence, and the game continues.
If the player fails to repeat the correct sequence, the game ends.
The objective of the game is to repeat the longest sequence possible without making a mistake.
Simon is a fun and challenging game that tests memory, reflexes, and cognitive skills.
